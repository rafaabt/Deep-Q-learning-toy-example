# Deep-Q-learning-toy-example

## Description

A toy example on the use of reinforcement learning (with Deep Q-learning) to teach a robot how traverse a maze (example based on [this blog](https://blog.floydhub.com/an-introduction-to-q-learning-reinforcement-learning/)). A neural network (Fast Artificial Neural Network - FANN) can be used to learn rewards from state/action pairs.
